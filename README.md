# orientation-app

In August we released an app (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=kaust.orientationapp&hl=en) containing useful tools for the incoming students. The goal now is to convert this to a more general-purpose app aimed at all community members. Including, but not limited to, the following features:

- Phone book - Contains the phone numbers of all important contacts. By tapping on the screen you can add any number of your choice to your phone or sim card without having to type the details in by hand.
- Travel maps - maps.me package which gives detailed maps of Jeddah and Saudi Arabia, and includes all points of interest contributed by the community. Uses data from https://rawgit.com/Virtakuono/.kml-repository/master/JeddahPOIs.htm
- kbus - Based on http://kbus.info/ , highly detailed bus scheduling and planner app.
- Web Links - List of important websites

This is entirely open source, so any contribution would be appreciated. If you have questions, please post in the Issues page.
